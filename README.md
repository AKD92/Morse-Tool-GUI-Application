# Morse-Tool-GUI-Application-
The aim of this project is to design and offer a graphical frontend for my Morse Code Library libmorse.a. The output of this project will be an stand-alone application (exe) which can be used for conversion of morse code to other forms and vice versa. It is compiled using GCC 4.8 32 bit Windows port.
