# Morse-Tool-GUI-Application-

The aim of this project is to design and offer a graphical frontend for my Morse Code Library libmorse.a. The output of this project will be an stand-alone application (exe) which can be used for conversion of morse code to other forms and vice versa.

This project uses my Morse Code Library libmorse.a, hosted on my GitHub account under the name of repository "Morse-Code-Library"

The application of this project, morsetool.exe links statically with libmorse.a along with libbst.a, libstackqueue.a and liblinkedlist.a

libbst.a is standard C implementation of Dictionary data structure using Binary Search Tree (BST), libstackqueue.a is standard C implementation of Stack and Queue data structure and liblinkedlist.a is standard C implementation of Linked List data structure, both singly and doubly versions.

Graphical User Interface was built using IUP Interface library, which is a multiplatform C user interface toolkit, freely available.

This project is compiled using GCC 4.8 32 bit Windows port.
