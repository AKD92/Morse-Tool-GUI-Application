This is basically a conversion tool. It uses the library <b>libmorse.a</b> for all kinds of conversion and it is very convenient and easy to use. It is particularly useful if you wish to change your ASCII text to Morse code representation, Binary representation etc, and the reverse operations are also supported.

For example, ASCII Text <b>SOS</b> might be converted to its equivalent Morse Code <b>... --- ...</b> <i>DOT DOT DOT DASH DASH DASH DOT DOT DOT</i>


### Implemented Features:

* ASCII Text to Morse code conversion
* Morse Code to ASCII text conversion
* Morse Code to Binary conversion
* Binary to Morse Code conversion


### Code Dependencies

  * <b>libmorse.a</b> : A collection of algorithms and utility functions for transforming Morse code to other forms and vice versa.
  * <b>libbst.a</b> : General purpose Dictionary data structure, implemented using Binary Search Tree (BST).
  * <b>libstackqueue.a</b> : General purpose Stack and Queue data structures.
  * <b>liblinkedlist.a</b> : General purpose Linked List data structure, including both singly and doubly versions.


This project is compiled using <b>GCC 4.8.2 32 bit</b> Windows port.
