The aim of this project is to design and offer a graphical frontend for my Morse Code Library libmorse.a.
<br>The output of this project will be a stand-alone application (exe) which can be used for conversion of morse code to other forms and vice versa.</br>

### Implemented Features:
* ASCII Text to Morse code conversion
* Morse Code to ASCII text conversion
* Morse Code to Binary conversion
* Binary to Morse Code conversion

This project uses my Morse Code Library "libmorse.a", hosted on my GitHub account under the name of repository "Morse-Code-Library"

The application of this project, "morsetool.exe" (can be found inside of "bin" directory) links statically with "libmorse.a" along with "libbst.a", "libstackqueue.a" and "liblinkedlist.a".

This project is compiled using GCC 4.8 32 bit Windows port.
