The output of this project will be a stand-alone application (exe) which can be used for conversion of morse code to other forms and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThis project uses my Morse Code Library \"libmorse.a\", hosted on my GitHub account under the name of repository \"Morse-Code-Library\"\r\n\r\nThe application of this project, \"morsetool.exe\" (can be found inside of \"bin\" directory) links statically with \"libmorse.a\" along with \"libbst.a\", \"libstackqueue.a\" and \"liblinkedlist.a\".\r\n\r\nlibbst.a is standard C implementation of Dictionary data structure using Binary Search Tree (BST), libstackqueue.a is standard C implementation of Stack and Queue data structure and liblinkedlist.a is standard C implementation of Linked List data structure, including both singly and doubly versions.\r\n\r\nGraphical User Interface was built using IUP Interface library, which is a multiplatform C user interface toolkit, freely available.\r\n\r\nThis project is compiled using GCC 4.8 32 bit Windows port.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
