{"name":"Morse Tools","tagline":"A Open-Source program to decode Morse codes to other forms like Binary bit streams or ASCII Texts","body":"# Morse Tool (GUI Frontend)\r\n\r\nThis is basically a conversion tool. It demonstrates the library [libmorse.a](https://github.com/AKD92/Morse-Code-Conversion-Library) and it is very convenient and easy to use. It is particularly useful if you wish to ASCII text to Morse code representation, Binary representation etc, and the reverse is also supported.\r\n\r\n![Main Window](https://github.com/AKD92/Morse-Tool-GUI-Application/raw/master/scrn_1.png) ![](https://github.com/AKD92/Morse-Tool-GUI-Application/raw/master/scrn_2.png)\r\n\r\nThe aim of this open-source project is to design and offer a graphical frontend for my Morse Code Library [libmorse.a](https://github.com/AKD92/Morse-Code-Conversion-Library). The output of this project will be a stand-alone desktop application which can be used for conversion of morse code to other forms and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThis project uses my Morse Code Library [libmorse.a](https://github.com/AKD92/Morse-Code-Conversion-Library), hosted on my GitHub account.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n* ASCII Text to Morse code conversion\r\n* Morse Code to ASCII text conversion\r\n* Morse Code to Binary conversion\r\n* Binary to Morse Code conversion\r\n\r\nYou can download this application by clicking \"Download ZIP\" link. You can also build it from the source.\r\n\r\nThe output of this project, \"morsetool.exe\" (can be found inside of \"bin\" directory) links statically with \"libmorse.a\" along with \"libbst.a\", \"libstackqueue.a\" and \"liblinkedlist.a\".\r\n\r\n* [libbst.a](https://github.com/AKD92/Dictionary-ADT-by-BST) is standard C implementation of Dictionary data structure using Binary Search Tree (BST).\r\n* [libstackqueue.a](https://github.com/AKD92/Stack-and-Queue-ADT) is standard C implementation of Stack and Queue data structure.\r\n* [liblinkedlist.a](https://github.com/AKD92/Linked-List-ADT) is standard C implementation of Linked List data structure, including both singly and doubly versions.\r\n\r\nGraphical User Interface was built using [IUP](http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/) Interface library, which is a multiplatform and portable user interface toolkit, freely available.\r\n\r\nThis application is compiled using GCC 4.8.2 32 bit (MinGW).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
