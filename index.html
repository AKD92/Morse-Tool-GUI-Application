<hr>

<p><strong>Morse code</strong> is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks that can be directly understood by a skilled listener or observer without special equipment. This coding method was invented by American inventor <strong>Samuel Finley Breese Morse</strong> in 1836. Each Morse code symbol represents either a text character (letter or numeral) or a prosign and is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes.</p>

<p>Compared to voice, Morse code is less sensitive to poor signal conditions, yet still comprehensible to humans without a decoding device. Morse is therefore a useful alternative to synthesized speech for sending automated data to skilled listeners on voice channels. In an emergency, Morse code can be sent by improvised methods that can be easily "keyed" on and off, making it one of the simplest and most versatile methods of telecommunication. The most common distress signal is <strong>SOS</strong> or three dots, three dashes and three dots, internationally recognized by treaty.

<p>This is basically a conversion tool. It uses the library <a href="https://github.com/AKD92/Morse-Code-Conversion-Library">libmorse.a</a> for all kinds of conversion and it is very convenient and easy to use. It is particularly useful if you wish to change your ASCII text to Morse code representation, Binary representation etc, and the reverse operations are also supported.</p>

<p>For example, ASCII Text <strong>"SOS"</strong> might be converted to its equivalent Morse Code <strong>"... --- ..."</strong> (DOT DOT DOT DASH DASH DASH DOT DOT DOT).</p>

<p>The aim of this open-source project is to design and offer a graphical frontend for my Morse Code Library <a href="https://github.com/AKD92/Morse-Code-Conversion-Library">libmorse.a</a>. The output of this project will be a stand-alone desktop application which can be used for conversion of morse code to other forms and vice versa.</p>

<a id="project-background" class="anchor" href="#project-background" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Background</h2>

<p>I should not forget to mention that, this project is a byproduct of another project of mine, namely <strong>"Secret message tranmitter and receiver via Morse Code"</strong> as a part of the university course <strong>Digital System Design (DSD)</strong>. On that project, we were a group of 4 team members to develop a microcontroller-based solution by which Morse code can be sent from one place to another wirelessly, and at the receiver end the actual ASCII text of the message received from sender's machine could be seen.</p>

<p>Wireless transmission of morse signals, Input of morse code and conversion of Morse code to Binary and ASCII Text all were done by the microcontroller we've used. I had to program that microcontroller (an <strong>Arduino</strong>) for implementing morse conversion routines, and here, this project is a slightly modified version of that original work in order to bring broader range of capabilities, convenience and performance.</p>
